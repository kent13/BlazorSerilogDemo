# BlazorSerilogDemo

This is a demonstration and learning project to use Serilog withing a Blazor WASM solution.

The home page has buttuns to Log at differnt levels.

The Log Viewer page lets you see the current log, change the logging level and number of events to log.

The Log Details page shows the details of one entry. Of note here is the Exception unwrapping and html display.

I built this using example code and ideas from William Liebenberg and Nicholas Blumhardt. Thanks guys for sharing.
